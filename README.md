# Bypass WhatsApp Web Anti AntiFingerprint

### NOTE: this project is archived and is probably not working anymore

Since [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com) is obfuscated, I don't really
know why but when you have `privacy.resistFingerprinting` on `true` the QRCode
used to connect to your phone disappears instantaneously after loading.

This simple [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)'s script will fix
this __"glitch"__.

Tested on Linux / Windows && Firefox.
